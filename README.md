# node-red-contrib-mongodb4
A MongoDB client node for Node-Red powered by MongoDB Driver 4.

This package includes two nodes for node-red:
* A configuration node which defines a connection to a MongoDB database server.
* A flow node to execute every MongoDB collection operation supported by MongoDB Driver 4.

This node was inspired by other projects like [node-red-contrib-mongodb3](https://github.com/ozomer/node-red-contrib-mongodb2) or [node-red-node-mongodb](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-mongodb).

## Compatibility
This MongoDB Node is compatible with the following MongoDB Server versions:
5.1, 5.0, 4.4, 4.2, 4.0, 3.6

You will also need a node-red version with NodeJS v12 or v14.

## Installation
Navigate to your .node-red directory - typically `~/.node-red`.
```
  npm install node-red-contrib-mongodb4
```

## Usage Example
Import the example flow to get a quick introduction how to use this node.

## The Configuration Node
Configuration node for MongoDB connection config.
This node will create a MongoDB client, with a connection pool for operation nodes.

### Options
#### Protocol
`mongodb` or `mongodb+srv`

#### Hostname
Hostname / IP to connect to MongoDB

#### Port
Default port is 27017.

#### Database
A MongoDB database name.

#### AuthSource
Specify the database name associated with the userâ€™s credentials.

#### AuthMech
Specify the authentication mechanism that MongoDB will use to authenticate the connection.

#### TLS CA-File
Specifies the location of a local .pem file that contains the root certificate chain from the Certificate Authority. This file is used to validate the certificate presented by the mongod/mongos instance.

#### TLS-Insecure
Disables various certificate validations. THIS IS REALLY NOT SECURE.

#### Advanced Options
MongoDB Driver 4 MongoClient supports more options. Feel free to overwrite all client options with your own JSON-Config-String.
[MongoClientOptions](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.2/interfaces/MongoClientOptions.html)

### Connection Pools
Each configuration node has his own connection pool with a default max poolsize of 100 connection at a given time. More parallel connections / operations will be queued and processed synchronous. In this scenario slow operations will delay fast operations. You can create more separat connection pools with more configuration nodes.

## The Operation Node

Execute MongoDB collection operations with this node.

### Connection

Select a MongoDB database server connection.

### Collection

MongoDB database collection static definition or with `msg.collection`

### Operation

A MongoDB Driver 4 collection CRUD operation for example `find`, `insertOne`, `updateOne`, `aggregate` and many more.

Read the full documentation here: [Collection-API](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.2/classes/Collection.html)

### Payload Input

Pass the CRUD operation arguments as message payload.
Message payload has to be array type to pass multiple function arguments to driver operation.
Example: `msg.payload = [{_id: '123'},{fields: {...}}]`.
The payload array will be passed as function arguments for the MongoDB driver collection operation, like so: `collection.find({_id: '123'}, {fields: {...}})`

More information here:
[Collection-API](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/4.2/classes/Collection.html)

### Payload Output

The node will output the database driver response as message payload.
The operations `aggregate` and `find` can output with `toArray` or `forEach`.
